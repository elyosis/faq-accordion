# FAQ accordion card

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion card challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-card-XlyjD0Oam). It uses the native `details` and `summary` HTML elements rather than JavaScript to achieve the accordion functionality. JavaScript is only used to animate one of the images when hovering over the questions.

## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
